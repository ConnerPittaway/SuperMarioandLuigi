# SuperMarioandLuigi
By using SDL and C++ I was able to create a game engine which loads the original two levels of Mario using text files and tilesets.
The game can be played in multiplayer and can be adapted for any kind of game since the map loader simply loads tilesets which can be changed.
Animations as well as collisions are in place and the game plays just like the original! A video of the project can be found at
